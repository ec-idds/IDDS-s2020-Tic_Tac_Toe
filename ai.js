 *           INSTRUCTIONS
 *
 * - Write your AI in this file.
 * - You may create new functions, variables, and anything else your AI needs in this file.
 * - Don't edit the sketch.js file. You can look, but don't touch.
 * - The AI takes one turn at a time.
 * - The AI is invoked when the game calls the aiSelect() function.
 * - The aiSelect() function returns the number of which cell to mark, 0-8:
 *
 *     0 | 1 | 2
 *    -----------
 *     3 | 4 | 5
 *    -----------
 *     6 | 7 | 8
 *
 * - The AI may NOT edit the game state in any way.
 * - The AI MUST return 0-8 from aiSelect (as long the game hasn't ended yet, after which we don't care)
 * - The AI may look at the game state variables: board, gridSize, etc, but not change them.
 *
 * - The game is 2-dimensional, but the board is stored a 1-dimensional array, using the cell numbers above.
 * - If you want to think about the board as 2D, we provided a function board2d() to provide a 2d interface to it.
 * - Each cell of the board is either 'X', 'O', or '', where empty string means the cell is empty.
